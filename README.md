# Gender and Age Classification

üéØ **Project Overview**  
The Gender and Age Classification project uses deep learning with OpenCV's DNN module to classify gender and estimate age in real-time. The system processes images, videos, or webcam streams and overlays predictions directly on the input frames.

‚ú® **Features**  
- **Real-Time Predictions**  
  - Detects gender (Male/Female) and age range (e.g., 25-32) in real-time.  
  - Works with webcam streams, image files, and video inputs.  
- **Face Detection**  
  - Utilizes OpenCV's DNN module to accurately detect faces in input frames.  
- **Hardware Acceleration**  
  - Supports both CPU and GPU inference for faster processing.  
- **Pre-Trained Models**  
  - Leverages robust Caffe models for gender and age classification.
